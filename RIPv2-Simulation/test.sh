# Tests implementation of Split-horizon routing with poison reverse
# Routers 1, 2 and three are connected thusly
#                (1)------(2)------(3)
# If not Split-horizon with poison reverse(SHPR) is not implemented
# and link between 2-3 goes down, a loop between 1 and 2 will form
# as router 1 advertises a route to (3) and so router (2) will update
# its routing table with that entry once the broken link is detected.
# Because of this the router 3 is not removed from the routing table until
# the metric reaches infinity(16 in this case).

# With SHPR implemented this should take significantly less time and converge
# Faster
